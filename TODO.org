#+TITLE: newm agenda

* Current
** General
- [ ] Stacking functionality
- [X] layout.move() / layout.resize() functions with keybindings
- [ ] MoveResizeOverlay: Fix jumps if we start in an out-of-bounds state
- [ ] MoveResizeOVerlay: Focus view on close to reduce cases where we end up in out-of-bounds state
- [ ] Use swayidle
- [ ] Use opacity during rescale to make the change less obvious / ugly

** README / Videos / Install guide and tests on other machines

* Backlog
** Configuration
- [ ] Keybindings
- [ ] File structure (Install to .local/lib, config script in .config/newm) incl. installation
- [ ] SysBackend
- [ ] TopBar / BottomBar
- [ ] Launcher

* Ideas
** Titles during "far-away" view
** Autoplace the first couple of windows more like i3 (i.e. resizing existing windows / tiling)
** NW.js bars (optional)
** Follow XDG for starter entries
