#+TITLE: newm agenda

* Current (aiming for v0.1.0)
** Bugs / Technical debt
*** DONE Bug: Open 4 windows (00, 01, 10, 11), resize 11 to cover all 4 fields -> stacking is wrong (correct if 00 is resized)
*** DONE Default background in resources
*** STRT Clean-up imports
*** STRT Bug: newm-panel-basic lock is not working in greeter-mode

** Documentation
*** STRT README / Install guide / Video / Efficiency comparison to sway
*** TODO Test documentation on clean VM

* Backlog / Ideas
** Titles during OverviewOverlay
** Move / Resize during OverviewOverlay
** Allow certain overlays to start during animations (e.g. 3/4-Finger-Swipe during animation one view)
** Autoplace the first couple of windows more like i3 (i.e. resizing existing windows / tiling)
** Bars as panels not as widgets
** Create newm-panel-flutter
