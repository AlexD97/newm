#+TITLE: newm agenda

* Current (aiming for v0.1.0)
** Fixes / Technical debt
- [X] Triggering OverviewOverlay during new view animation causes this view to disappear
- [ ] Generalize _animation / update / animate_to in view / widget / layout

** Session management / Lock screen
- [X] Lock screen: Unlock via python-pam
- [X] Lock screen: Start session via pygreetd_ipc
- [ ] Automatically lock on hibernate
- [ ] Idle management: dim screen / lock after some time (see swayidle) / dim on lock

** Improve panels
- [X] Embed font to make it available in greeter-mode
- [ ] Clean-up panel installation / launch-script
- [ ] Improve visually
- [ ] Lock: Default user / tabs to switch users, buttons to restart / shutdown / ...

** Usability
- [ ] Stacking functionality
- [ ] New (more like classic) fullscreen functionality (especially necessary if there are 2 1x2 windows)
- [ ] MoveResizeOverlay
  + [ ] Fix jumps if we start in an out-of-bounds state
  + [ ] Focus view on close to reduce cases where we end up in out-of-bounds state
  + [ ] Exit is oftentimes too slow (small dx, but also small p -> full animation duration) - especially noticeable if switching to Three-Finger-Swipe
  + [ ] Enforce bounds more tightly - i.e. only allow scrolling beyond bounds if necessary (scale = 2, but only 1x1 window) or we are at the border and explicitly scroll further
  + [ ] Better logic for decision if we jump on final() - i.e. make necessary momentum for dx=1 smaller than is now, but for dx=2 bigger than is now

** README / Videos / Install guide and tests on other machines

** Configuration
- [ ] Read config file from .config/newm with info now in run.py and layout.py
- [ ] Keybindings
- [ ] SysBackend
- [ ] TopBar / BottomBar

* Backlog / Ideas
** Titles during "far-away" view
** Improve panel handling (Monitor forked processes / identify based on pid / ...)
** Configurable launcher (XDG)
** Allow certain overlays to start during animations (e.g. 3/4-Finger-Swipe during animation one view)
** Autoplace the first couple of windows more like i3 (i.e. resizing existing windows / tiling)
** Bars as panels not as widgets
** Move panels away from NW.js
