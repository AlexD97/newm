#+TITLE: newm developer information

* Current (v0.3)
** Bugs
**** STRT FocusBorder is visible on non-selected monitor
**** TODO FocusBorder (possibly SSD as well) sometimes shows up before newm closes (after fade-out animation has finished)

** Improvements
*** TODO Make gestures configurable to some extent - i.e. enable / disable certain behaviours, exchange 3- / 4- / 5-finger-swipes
*** TODO Keychord bindings
*** TODO Configurable locking behaviour (blur, dim, squish) - don't expose texture_shaders as config option
*** TODO Switch to last focused window (i.e. make switching between two windows via one shortcut possible)
*** TODO Scale windows moving others "out of the way"
*** TODO Swiping between fullscreen windows should not exit fullscreen
*** TODO rofi / dmenu app-switcher via newm-cmd
*** TODO Move all configurable debug options into `debug.xyz = True`

** Improved panel
*** STRT Always present top and bottom bars --> incl. autodetect if bar is there and of which size

** TODO NixOS greetd deployment

** Documentation
**** Update to v0.3
**** newm-panel-nwjs is history

* Backlog
** dbus endpoint for waybar etc
** Support swaylock
** Don't have double padding between windows
** Layer shell - Exclusive zones and keyboard interactivity
** Video on newm-sidecar
** Titles during Overview
** More detailed config on Layout class
** Ability to increase size of rows or cols (e.g. in 1x2 | 1x2)
** Ultrawide monitors --> two workspaces on one output
** Move to resize overlay: Trigger size changes on invisible windows only in finish transition? Analogous to interpolate
** Move tiles from workspace to another -> animate size change instead of jump
** Allow certain overlays to start during animations (e.g. 3/4-Finger-Swipe during animation one view)
** Autoplace the first couple of windows more like i3 (i.e. resizing existing windows / tiling)
** Dynamic background
** Possible and sensible to use a decorater for layout methods where reducer is defined and then an animation is started?


* Setup clean arch chroot / qemu for testing
** Setup chroot

Following https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2019/03/20/bootstraping-a-minimal-arch-linux-image/

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
truncate -s 20G arch_disk.raw
mkfs.ext4 arch_disk.raw
mkdir mnt
sudo mount arch_disk.raw mnt
sudo pacstrap mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware
sudo arch-chroot mnt
#+END_SRC

Now we are inside the chroot, very basic setup:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
passwd
pacman -S dhcpcd

useradd --create-home test
passwd test
usermod -aG wheel test
vim /etc/sudoers # add wheel
su test
#+END_SRC

Finally clean up

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
exit
sudo umount mnt
#+END_SRC

** Setup virtual machine

To use the disk in a virtual machine (not incredibly nice...)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo mount arch_disk.raw mnt
cp -r mnt/boot mnt_boot
sudo umount mnt
#+END_SRC

and start using

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
qemu-system-x86_64 --enable-kvm -hda arch_disk.raw -m 4G -kernel mnt_boot/vmlinuz-linux -initrd mnt_boot/initramfs-linux[-fallback].img -append "root=/dev/sda rw" -vga virtio
#+END_SRC

To enable internet access, probably

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
systemctl enable dhcpcd
systemctl start dhcpcd
#+END_SRC

is necessary
