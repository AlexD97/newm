#+TITLE: newm developer information

* Current (v0.2)
** Bugs / Technical debt
*** TODO Regularly remove orphaned view states
*** TODO Verify rounding performance on different scales at very slow anim speed
*** TODO Bug: Stacked windows are not scaled properly
*** STRT Bug: 1x2 + 1x1 layout scale right window wover left, background rescales?
*** STRT Background: With second scale == 1 screen open, background widgets are not rounded based on scale > 1 pixels, but on logical pixels
*** DONE Bug: Occasionally rofi opens too small
*** STRT Bug: Occasionally slurp does not get a fixed_output in therefore never shows up
*** DONE Bug: pos_hint goes back to (0, 0)

** TODO Overview per output (configurable)
** TODO Interpolation: Trigger size updates on view outside of workspace after anim has finished - this should make fullscreen enter-leave animations in situations with lots of windows a bit smoother
** TODO Move to resize overlay: Trigger size changes on invisible windows only in finish transition
** TODO Basic demo of layer shell top bar
** TODO Background: Configurable w0, h0 and per output background, as well as additional no_anim flag
** TODO Maybe: scale padding with ws_state.size

** Release
- [ ] TESTS: Move here from pywm / compare with weston, where things don't work on sway / Add DBeaver / Add virt-manager
- [ ] TODO comments
- [ ] New background
- [ ] Document newm-cmd open/close-virtual-output - link to newm-sidecar
- [ ] Remove any legacy config options
- [ ] Document new config options


* v0.3
** Layer shell - Exclusive zones and keyboard interactivity
** Scale windows moving others "out of the way"
** Ultrawide monitors --> two workspaces on one output
** Improved panel
- Bars as panels not as widgets
- layer-shell
- catapult
- Drop websockets and with that newm-panel-nwjs but keep newm_panel_basic

** Widgets
- Animated border around current window
- Titles during OverviewOverlay

* Backlog / Ideas
** Dynamic background
** Move tiles from workspace to another -> animate size change instead of jump
** Allow certain overlays to start during animations (e.g. 3/4-Finger-Swipe during animation one view)
** Autoplace the first couple of windows more like i3 (i.e. resizing existing windows / tiling)


* Setup clean arch chroot / qemu for testing

** Setup chroot

Following https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2019/03/20/bootstraping-a-minimal-arch-linux-image/

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
truncate -s 20G arch_disk.raw
mkfs.ext4 arch_disk.raw
mkdir mnt
sudo mount arch_disk.raw mnt
sudo pacstrap mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware
sudo arch-chroot mnt
#+END_SRC

Now we are inside the chroot, very basic setup:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
passwd
pacman -S dhcpcd

useradd --create-home test
passwd test
usermod -aG wheel test
vim /etc/sudoers # add wheel
su test
#+END_SRC

Finally clean up

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
exit
sudo umount mnt
#+END_SRC

** Setup virtual machine

To use the disk in a virtual machine (not incredibly nice...)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo mount arch_disk.raw mnt
cp -r mnt/boot mnt_boot
sudo umount mnt
#+END_SRC

and start using

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
qemu-system-x86_64 --enable-kvm -hda arch_disk.raw -m 4G -kernel mnt_boot/vmlinuz-linux -initrd mnt_boot/initramfs-linux[-fallback].img -append "root=/dev/sda rw" -vga virtio
#+END_SRC

To enable internet access, probably

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
systemctl enable dhcpcd
systemctl start dhcpcd
#+END_SRC

is necessary
