# NeWM - PyWM reference implementation

## ToDo

- Starter panel
- Battery warning
- Scale windows in on open
- Swipe Overlay: Bouncy overswipe effect (i.e. not a whole tile)
- Unified handling of stoppable threads spawned by layout.py

## Backlog

- Center windows of 1x2 or 2x1 in regular view and overview
- Improve "find next window" logic on Alt-hjkl
- Titles during "far-away" view
- Cut down on shortcuts - moving and resizing windows with the touchpad
- Useful to zoom out beyond scale=2 or 3?
- Autoplace the first couple of windows more like i3 (i.e. resizing existing windows / tiling)
