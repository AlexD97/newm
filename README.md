# NeWM - PyWM reference implementation

## ToDo

- 2x1 tiles and OverviewOverlay
- Handle animations on closing of views

- SwipeOverlays / MoveResizeOverlays: Improve momenteum handling / Use momentum as basis for animation duration?
- Trigger Move without lifting finger first (works for resize)
- Block tiles on move / resize
- Adjust viewpoint during move
- Hide cursor during move / resize

- Starter panel


## Backlog

- Titles during "far-away" view
- htop / cmatrix or similar background / screensaver
- Autoplace the first couple of windows more like i3 (i.e. resizing existing windows / tiling)
