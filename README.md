# NeWM - PyWM reference implementation

## ToDo

- Media key widgets
- Why does the panel not show up initially?

## Backlog

- Center windows of 1x2 or 2x1 in regular view and overview
- Improve "find next window" logic on Alt-hjkl
- Titles during "far-away" view
- Scale windows in on open
- Swipe Overlay: Bouncy overswipe effect (i.e. not a whole tile)
