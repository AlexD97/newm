# NeWM - PyWM reference implementation

## ToDo

- Move between windows
    - Improve "find next window" logic on Alt-hjkl
- Move PinchOverlay towards moving and resizing functionality -> get rid of Ctrl-Mod and Shift-Mod
- SwipeOverlays exit: Use momentum as basis for animation duration?
- Center windows of 1x2 or 2x1 in regular view and overview

- Starter panel
- Battery warning


## Backlog

- Titles during "far-away" view
- htop / cmatrix or similar background / screensaver
- Unified handling of stoppable threads spawned by layout.py

- Move Ctrl-Mod and Shift-Mod to an i3-like behaviour only on currently visible windows
- Autoplace the first couple of windows more like i3 (i.e. resizing existing windows / tiling)
