# NeWM - PyWM reference implementation

## ToDo

- Random overlay hangs?
- SwipeOverlays / MoveResizeOverlays: Improve momenteum handling / Use momentum as basis for animation duration?
- MoveResizeOverlay
    - Trigger Move without lifting finger first (works for resize)
    - Block already used tiles
    - Adjust viewpoint during move
    - Hide cursor during move / resize (alternatively move it)
    - Start gesture even during anim_block

- Starter panel


## Backlog

- Titles during "far-away" view
- htop / cmatrix or similar background / screensaver
- Autoplace the first couple of windows more like i3 (i.e. resizing existing windows / tiling)
